# 🎭 Playwright E2E — TypeScript + Python + MCP

A modern, batteries-included end-to-end testing reference framework built on
**Playwright 1.61** (June 2026). It showcases current best practices in **both
TypeScript and Python**, ships ready-to-run CI, and is wired up for **AI agents
via the Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

The suite tests the public [Sauce Demo](https://www.saucedemo.com) app and a
public sandbox API, so you can clone and run it immediately.

## ✨ What's inside

| Area | Highlights |
| --- | --- |
| **Locators** | Role / test-id / label locators only — no `page.$()` ElementHandles |
| **Page Object Model** | Clean POM in both languages with a shared `BasePage` |
| **Fixtures** | Custom fixtures inject page objects; shared auth via `storageState` |
| **Auth** | Log in once in a `setup` project, reuse the session everywhere |
| **API testing** | Browserless `request` context tests + JSON assertions |
| **Network mocking** | `page.route` interception & response stubbing |
| **Visual & ARIA** | `toMatchAriaSnapshot` + pixel screenshots |
| **Accessibility** | axe-core scans (WCAG 2.1 A/AA) in both stacks |
| **Reporting** | HTML report, blob reports merged across shards, GitHub annotations |
| **CI** | Sharded GitHub Actions, lint + typecheck gates, browser caching |
| **Containers** | Pinned Playwright Docker images + `docker compose` |
| **CI checks** | A fast browser-free `Validate` gate (typecheck/lint/format, spec-compile, config & skills) + full sharded suites |
| **AI / MCP** | Playwright, Filesystem & GitHub MCP servers ([docs](docs/MCP.md)) |
| **Agent Skills** | Reusable Playwright-MCP playbooks in [`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills/) |

## 🚀 Quick start — TypeScript

```bash
cd typescript
npm install
npx playwright install --with-deps

npm test                 # run everything
npm run test:ui          # interactive UI mode (time-travel debugging)
npm run test:smoke       # only @smoke-tagged tests
npm run test:e2e         # only @e2e
npm run test:api         # API project
npm run report           # open the last HTML report
npm run codegen          # record a new test
```

Update visual / ARIA baselines: `npm test -- --update-snapshots`.

## 🐍 Quick start — Python

```bash
cd python
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m playwright install --with-deps chromium

pytest                       # run everything (headless chromium)
pytest -m smoke              # only smoke tests
pytest -m api                # API tests
pytest --headed --slowmo 500 # watch it run
pytest -n auto               # parallel across CPU cores
```

## 🤖 AI agents via MCP

This repo is agent-ready. With Claude Code (or any MCP client) the
[`.mcp.json`](.mcp.json) config exposes a **Playwright MCP** server so an agent
can drive a real browser through accessibility snapshots — explore flows,
reproduce bugs, and draft new tests — plus Filesystem and GitHub servers.

```bash
claude            # from repo root; reads .mcp.json automatically
# then: "Use the playwright MCP to log into saucedemo and add a backpack to the cart."
```

### Agent Skills

Reusable **playbooks** in [`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills/) teach agents how to
use the Playwright MCP for real tasks — Claude Code auto-discovers them and
invokes the right one from your request (or call `/<skill-name>` directly):

| Skill | Use it to… |
| --- | --- |
| `playwright-explore` | Walk a live flow via accessibility snapshots |
| `playwright-generate-test` | Turn an explored flow into a hardened POM spec |
| `playwright-a11y-audit` | Run an axe-core WCAG audit on a live page |
| `playwright-debug-failure` | Reproduce & diagnose a failing/flaky test |
| `playwright-visual-baseline` | Preview, author & update visual / ARIA snapshots |

See [docs/MCP.md](docs/MCP.md) for server details and [.claude/skills/](.claude/skills/README.md)
for the full playbooks.
